## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA)
- it aims to promote reusability and business agility.
2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
	2.1. Standardized service contract- it allows service to the consumers access and help to the service as well
	2.2. Loose coupling - An Enterprise can now treat each layer independently from the other.
	2.3. Abstraction - Abstraction allows the Enterprise to define technology in the context of a business process
	2.4 Reusability - Reusability creates a flywheel effect for innovation
	2.5 Autonomy - Users can then consume this service in a secure defined way in any compatible front end with no other needed dependencies
	2.6  Statelessness - You can cache data but that is a capability that the service can utilize as an option but will not depend on it
	2.7 Discoverability - To support reuse, a service must be able to be found by a consumer
	2.8 Composability - Enable your organization to combine packaged business capabilities to define business processes
3. Define Microservices - it is design for creating a distributed application using containers
4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices
	4.1. improved productivity - through detailing it makes easier to build and maintain
	4.2. Better resiliency - it adds ease to the process of  identifying and resolving the root cause of performance issues
	4.3. Increased scalability - it allows DevOps teams to choose the most appropriate tech stack for each module without concerns about incompatibility.
	4.4. Continuous integration - it allows cross-functional teams to develop, test, problem-solve, deploy, and update services independently, which leads to faster 		deployment and troubleshooting turnaround times. 
	4.5 Optimize business functionality -  itâ€™s easier to customize the needs of each component to improve business functionality.
5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
